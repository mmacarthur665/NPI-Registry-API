# NPI-Registry-API
This script is used to extract information on individual and organizational medical providers in the United States. 

The code as it is written currently, will extract information on all individual providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) in the state of MA. It can be adjusted to other states by 
swapping out the list of zip codes it queries. The documentation for this api can be found here: https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api
